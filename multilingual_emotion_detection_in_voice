**📁 `multilingual_emotion_detection_in_voice (7).ipynb`**

Here’s a summary of its purpose and structure:

---

### 🎯 **Project Goal**

The notebook is designed to **detect emotions in speech**, handling **multiple languages**. It uses audio processing and machine learning/deep learning methods to classify emotional states such as happy, sad, angry, etc., from voice recordings.

---

### 🧱 **Notebook Structure and Components**

#### 1. **📦 Imports and Setup**

Includes common libraries like:

* `librosa`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – for audio and data processing
* `sklearn`, `tensorflow`, `keras` – for machine learning and deep learning
* `os`, `glob`, etc. – for file handling

#### 2. **🎙️ Audio Processing**

* Uses **Librosa** to extract audio features:

  * **MFCC** (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
  * **Chroma**
  * **Mel Spectrogram**
* Normalization and padding/trimming of audio clips for consistent input

#### 3. **🌐 Multilingual Support**

* Handles datasets in different languages (if available)
* May include logic to identify language or handle different accents

#### 4. **📊 Feature Extraction**

* Extracts and aggregates audio features per file
* Stores extracted features in a structured format (e.g., DataFrame)

#### 5. **🧠 Model Training**

* Typically includes a classifier like:

  * **Random Forest**, **SVM**, or
  * Deep learning model (e.g., **LSTM**, **CNN**)
* Data split into training/test sets using `train_test_split`

#### 6. **📈 Evaluation**

* Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports used to evaluate model performance
* Visualizations such as plots for feature distribution and model metrics

#### 7. **💾 Prediction and Output**

* Predicts the emotion from test audio samples
* May include audio player or sample outputs inline

* Happy
* Sad
* Angry
